Intro
-----

For new year 2011 a friend needed a countdown timer for a new years party he was doing the tech for so I knocked together this simple countdown timer for him and learnt a fair bit about building a Java GUI along the way :).

Can be displayed windowed or full screen. Supports multi screen displays and adjusts to make best use of screen space.

To toggle full screen click on the countdown. Repeatedly toggling full screen will cycle through monitors allowing the countdown to be displayed on an external monitor.
